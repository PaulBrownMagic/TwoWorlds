# Rogue: Through The Veil

Rogue: Through The Veil is yet another roguelike. In this twist on the
classic game, you are constrained to a dungeon of your normal, everyday
monsters and items. However, just beyond the veil there exists a magical
world where incredible creatures roam and mystical items await
discovery. During your search for the Amulet of Yendor, you will
discover how to go beyond the veil, transitioning between the realms of
reality and the magical. You will be able to bring magical items back to
the real world to aid you in your quest, but beware, the magical world
is a dangerous place.
